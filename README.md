# Signal_Equalizer
 The Signal Equalizer is a fundamental tool in the fields of music, speech, and biomedical engineering. This web-based application allows users to manipulate the magnitude of specific frequency components of a signal using intuitive sliders. The resulting modified signal can then be reconstructed and played back in real-time.

Aside from its prominent role in the music and speech industries, the Signal Equalizer can also be applied in biomedical applications, such as detecting abnormalities in hearing aids.

By leveraging this tool's interactive interface, users can efficiently enhance specific aspects of a signal's quality, ultimately leading to an improved listening experience for end-users.
